We appreciate pull requests, here are the guidelines:

1. File a bug at https://github.com/tony-jones/frankenstein/issues (if there
isnâ€™t one already). If your patch is going to be large it might be a good idea
to get the discussion started early. We are happy to discuss it in a new issue beforehand.
1. Make sure that patches provide justification for why they should be merged. Patches which add support for alternative choices to those we prescribe are not guaranteed to land.
1. We ask that you squash all the commits together before pushing.
