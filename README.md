## Overview

Frankenstein is a responsive front-end framework that doesnâ€™t use any
JavaScript frameworks. It pulls in inspiration and some features from frameworks
such as Twitter Bootstrap, Materialize, Material Design Lite, and other article
I have read in the past. Hence the name Frankenstein.
